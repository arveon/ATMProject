To simulate the race condition you need to follow the steps:
1. Create two FIXED or two BROKEN machines.
2. Insert the same card into both of them:
	2.1. Select a bank account in the ListBox on the bottom right corner of the ATM.
	2.2. Press "Insert a button"
3. Enter PIN for the card correctly - 1111 for 111111, 2222 for 222222 and 3333 for 333333
4. Press on Withdraw money menu option on both machines
5. Select the amount to withdraw on the both machines
	5.1. You have to select the amount to withdraw on the second machine within 3 seconds after you selected it on the first ATM.
	5.2. Transaction takes 3 seconds.

P.S. If you follow the steps and used the BROKEN machines you will see that the bank registered only the first transaction, even though the ATM confirmed that the transaction
was successful.
With the FIXED machines, the account balance will be updated correctly.
